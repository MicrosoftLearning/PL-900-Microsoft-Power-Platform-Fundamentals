## Scenario

Bellows College is an educational organization with multiple campuses and programs. Many of Bellow Colleges instructors and administrators need to attend events, and purchase items. Historically tracking these expenses has been a challenge. 

Campus administration would like to modernize their expense reporting system by providing employees with a digital way to report expenses. 

Throughout this course, you will build applications and perform automation to enable the Bellows College employees to manage expenses. 


## High-level lab steps

We will follow the below outline to design the canvas app:

- Create an expense report canvas app 

- Configure how expense reports are shown on the browse screen

- Make some basic changes to the app

- Test the app functionality

## Prerequisites

- Completion of **Module 1 Lab 0 - Validate lab environment**

## Exercise 1: Create Expense Reports Canvas app

### Objective: In this exercise, you will create a canvas app by connecting to an Expense Reports table.

### Task #1: Create the Expense Reports app

1. Navigate to `https://make.powerapps.com`

Congratulations, you have successfully created a Power App from a Dataverse table. The next step in the process is to tailor the app to match your organizations branding. The next series of steps will walk you through providing some extra customization to the app.

### Task #2: Modify and theme the newly created app

In this task, you will customize the header text on each of the three screens for your app (Browse, Detail, and Edit) and change the app theme.

1. You are on the Browse screen. Select the **Expense Reports** label on the screen.

### Task #3: Test your Expense Reports app

1. With your application open in the App Designer, select **Settings** (You might need to select â€¦ for the Setting Icon to display), in the **General** section update the name of your app to `Expense Report App` select the **X** to close the settings screen and then select **Save**.

1. Using the navigation on the left, select **BrowseScreen**.

1. In the app designer, select the **Preview the app** button (Play icon) on the command bar. (You can also preview the app by pressing F5.)

1. Once the app opens, in the **Search items** field, enter the text `Trip` (Notice how the items in the gallery filter based on what is typed in the search field).

1. Once the **Trip to Power Platform Conference** record is displayed, select a row to navigate and open the Details screen for that Expense.
 
    >**Note**: If more than one Trip to Power Platform Conference record is displayed, select any of them.

1. To edit the record, select the **Pencil Icon** in the upper right corner of the app.
