## Learning Objective

In this exercise, learners will use Plan designer to build a complete, targeted business solution that can include apps, workflows, agents and more. Copilot will guide you through the entire process of creating the solution.

Upon successful completion of this lab, you will:**

- Use Plan designer to build a solution.
- Use the Data agent to build a data model.
- Use the Solution agent to generate the different components needed.

### Scenario

Contoso Consulting is a professional services organization specializing in IT and AI consulting services. Since they have switched to a hybrid-work model, many of Contoso's employees are working from home. This causes challenges as their employees often need to check out equipment.

Contoso would like to use Power Platform to build a solution to manage checking in and out of equipment.

In this exercise you are going to use Plan designer in Microsoft Power Platform to provide a description of the business challenge you are trying to solve, and use the recommendations to craft a solution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This lab uses AI to build out the components. Since AI results can vary, it’s important to note that you results may be different (but similar) to what is defined in the lab. The basic concepts outlined in the lab will be the same no matter what was created or what it was named. If the objects that are suggested/created do not match what is listed in the instructions exactly, you may need to make you adjustments based on what was created for you.*

### Lab Timing

The estimated time to complete this exercise is **20 to 30** minutes.

## Task 1: Use Plan Designer to create a solution plan

**Use Plan Designer**

1. Open the [Power Apps maker](https://make.powerapps.com) portal and navigate to the **Home** screen.
2. Under **Let’s make a plan**, enter the following text: “*I need my staff to check out equipment and be notified of due dates.*”

3. Select the **Go** button.
4. Plan Designer will generate a plan based on the description that you provided. The plan will include the following:
    - Business Problem
    - Purpose of this plan
    - User requirements

The **Requirements agent** built the user requirements based on the description you provided and should be considered as a starting point for your plan. You can modify the requirements as needed.

    ![Screenshot of plan overview](media/6614c40776f6997ec0ad443a0ebaf318.png)

5. To change the requirements, select the **Edit** button.
6. In the **Copilot** field under the **User requirements** heading, enter: “*Staff should be able to report if there is an issue with the equipment while they have it checked out*.”
7. Select the **Go** button.

A new issue reporting requirement will be added to your plan.

8. Once you are happy with the requirements as they are listed, select the **Keep** button.
9. If you are happy with the requirements generated by the **Requirements agent**, select **Looks good**.

Next, the **Data model agent** assists you in creating your data model. It will make suggestions on what tables should be created to store the data for your solution.

    ![A screenshot of the Data Agent](media/d56d30ede28a710c51bd0600470796ca.png)

10.  To view the details of the model, select **Show Details**.

All the suggested tables, columns, and relationships will be displayed in the data model designer. You can use the Copilot pane to make changes to the data model.

11.  In the **Copilot** pane on the right side of the screen, enter the following: “*Add a text column to the Equipment table called Item number.*”
12.  After the column is added to the **Equipment** table, use **Copilot** to enter the following prompts individually:
    - “Add a new text column to the Staff/Employee table called Manager.”
    - “Add a new choice column to the Equipment table called Equipment Type.”
    - “Add a new choice column to the Equipment table called Equipment Type. “

    Your data model should look like the one listed below.

**Remember:** It will likely not match exactly. And that is OK.

15.  In the **Solution Agent**, select the **Edit** button.
16.  In the **Copilot** field, under the Technology heading, enter the following: *“Create an item checkout agent to answer employee questions.”*
17.  Select the **Go** button.
18.  An **Item Checkout Agent** will be added. Select **Keep**.
19.  If you are happy with the suggestions from the **Solution Agent**, select **Looks good**.
20.  Select **Save Tables** build the data model that is suggested.

Plan designer builds solution files for all the plans you create. A solution is a critical component of Application lifecycle Management (ALM).

21.  On the **Where do you want to save thigs** screen, set the Name of the solution to Equipment Checkout System and select the **Save** button.

    ![Screenshot of the solution that will be created.](media/58f251e3404a38c6fd2905cd5f422ed4.png)
