## Scenario

Bellows College is an educational organization with multiple campuses and programs. Many of Bellow Colleges instructors and administrators need to attend events, and purchase items. Historically tracking these expenses has been a challenge.

Campus administration would like to modernize their expense reporting system by providing employees with a digital way to report expenses.

Throughout this course, you will build applications and perform automation to enable the Bellows College employees to manage expenses.

## High-level lab steps

As part of creating the model-driven app, you will complete the following:

- Create a new model-driven app named Employee Expense Management.

- Edit the app navigation to reference the required tables.

- Customize the forms and views of the required tables for the app.

We will work with the following components:

- **Views**: Views allow the user to display the existing data in the form table.

- **Forms**: This is where the user creates/updates new rows in the tables.

Both will be integrated to the model-driven app for a better user-experience.

### Prerequisites

- Completion of **Module 1 Lab 0 - Validate lab environment**

**Things to consider before you begin**

- What changes should we make to improve the user experience?

- What should we include in a model-driven app based on the data model we have built?

- What customizations can be made on the sitemap of a model-driven app?

## Exercise 1: Customize Views and Forms

**Objective:** In this exercise, you will customize views and forms of the custom created tables that will be used in the model-driven app.

### Task #1: Edit the Expense Report Form

1. If you are not already, sign in to https://make.powerapps.com

1. Select the **Dev One** environment at the top right if it isn't already selected.

1. Using the navigation on the left, select **Tables**, and open the **Expense Report** table.

	>If you do not see the Expense report table, make sure you are in the correct environment (Step 2).

1. Under the **Data experiences** section, select **Forms** and open the **Information** form with **Main** Form type. (**Important:** Make sure you select the form with the form type of **Main**.)

    >**IMPORTANT:** Since by default all forms are named Information, make sure to verify that the form you select has a Form Type of **Main** and not something else. By default, the form has two fields: Name and Owner.

1. On the right side of the screen on the **Properties** panel, select the **Display Name** field, and change it to `Report Information`.

1. Select **Table columns** from the left navigation pane and add the following fields below the **Owner** field by dragging columns to the form or simply clicking column names:

	- **Description**

	- **Report Purpose**

	- **Report due date**

	- **Report Total Amount**

1. Drag the **Status Reason** column and drop it in the form header.

	>The header is the top right area of the form. You may need to collapse the Properties panel on the right side of the screen to see the field on the form.

1. Select **Owner** field. In the Properties panel, change the **Label** to `Requestor`.

1. Select the **Save and publish** button at the top right and wait for the save and publish to complete.

1. If the Edit view opened in a new browser tab or window, close it. Otherwise, select **ðŸ¡  Back** at the top left of the screen. You should now be back to the **Expense Report** table Forms.

1. Using the breadcrumbs in the upper left (**Tables** > **Expense Report** > **Forms**). Select **Expense Report** to return to the **Expense Report** Table properties screen.

## Task #2: Edit the Active Expense Reports view

In this task, we will modify the default Active Expense Reports view and create a new view for expense reports due today.

1. Under the **Data experiences** section, select **Views** and open your **Active Expense Reports** view.

1. Add the following fields to the view by either clicking or dragging and dropping the fields:

	- **Report Purpose**

	- **Report due date**

	- **Report Total Amount**

1. Select the drop-down menu on the **Created On** column and select **Remove**. The field **Created On** will now be removed from the view.

1. Resize the individual column widths as suits to fit the data.

1. Under **Sort by â€¦** select the X to remove **Report Name** and instead, select **Report Total Amount**.

1. Select **Report Total Amount** to change the sort order to **Larger to smaller**.

1. Select the **Save and publish** button at the top right and wait for the publishing to complete.

### Task #3: Create a new view for Reports due today

Now, we will clone the view to create a new view for reports due today.

>    **IMPORTANT:** Make sure that you do not close the Active Expense Reports view, as we will be leveraging it to create the Reports due today view.

1. Select **Save As**.

1. Change the **Name** to `Expense Reports Due Today` and select **Save**.

1. Select **Edit filters**, in the Properties panel.

1. Select **+ Add**, select **Add row**.

1. Select **Report due date** as field, then change **Equals** to **Today** as the condition in the drop-down.

1. Select the **â€¦** **More commands** on the **Status** row and select **Delete** to delete that filter condition.

1. Select **Ok** to save the condition. The view is now filtered to show only records where the **Report due date** is today.

1. Add the **Reimbursement Amount** field to the view.

1. Select the **Save and publish** button at the top right and wait for the publishing to complete.

## Exercise 2: Create the model-driven app

**Objective:** In this exercise, you will create a model-driven app, customize the sitemap, and test the app.

For simplicity and timeâ€™s sake, we will not be addressing all of the Expense Report columns in this lab.

### Task #1: Create the app

1. If you are not already, sign in to https://make.powerapps.com

1. Select the **Dev One** environment at the top right, if it is not already selected.

1. Select **Solutions** on the left navigation.

1. Open **Expense Management** Solution.

1. Select **+New**, select **APP** and then select **Model-driven app**.

1. Enter `Employee Expense Management` for **Name** and select **Create**.

1. After your new model-driven application loads, select the **+ Add page** button.

1. On the **Add page** screen, choose **Dataverse table**.

1. Select the following tables:

	- Expense Report

	- Contact

1. After you have both tables, select **Add**.

1. Using the navigation icons on the left side of the screen, select **Navigation**.

1. On the Navigation Pane, select **New Group** below where it says Navigation. You may need to expand the menu on the left.

1. On the right side of the screen, in the **Display options** section, change the **Title** property to `Reports`.

1. Select **Save** and wait until the changes are saved.

1. Once the **Save** is complete, select the **Publish** button to publish your changes. Wait for the publishing to complete.

## Task #2: Test the app

**Start the application**

1. Select the **Play** button, the model-driven app will load in a new tab.

**Create a new Contact**

1. The app should open to the **My Active Contacts** view. If it does not, select **Contacts** on the left navigation.

1. Select **+ New** from the command bar.

1. Enter **First Name** as `John` and **Last Name** as `Doe`.

1. Provide your personal email as **Email**. This will be used in a future lab, where you will receive an email.

1. Select **Save &amp; Close**.

1. You should now see the created contact on the **My Active Contacts** view.

**Create a new Expense Report**

1. Select **Expense Reports** from the left-hand navigation (Also known as the sitemap.)

1. Select **+ New**.

1. Enter the fields as follows:

	- **Report Name**: `New Test Report`

	- **Report Purpose**: select **Conference**

	- **Report due date**: Select Today's date

1. Select **Save &amp; Close**. This will create the new Test Report and you should be able to see it on the **Active Expense Reports** view.

1. Change view to **Expense Reports Due Today** by using the drop-down next to **Active Expense Reports**. 

1. You may add some more test records.

Your running model-driven app should look approximately like the following:

Congratulations! You have created and configured your first model-driven app.
